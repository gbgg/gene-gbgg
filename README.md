This is the prototype of the README that I will want to put at the head of AAMA.
It should conntain informaton about what the json files represent. and the roles that
the various python scripts play in the formation and display of the information.

One of the big questions going forward is to whether I can bypass GitHub Desktop, and to what extent I can bypass VS Code, in maintaining the site going forward.
